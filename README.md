Overview
Looker is a modern data platform in Google Cloud that lets you analyze and visualize your data interactively. You can use Looker to do in-depth data analysis, integrate insights across different data sources, build actionable data-driven workflows, and create custom data applications.

Explores are data views that serve as the foundation for self-service exploration by the business users in Looker. In this lab, you learn how to take your Explores to the next level by applying filters to them.

What you'll do
In this lab, you learn how to:

Use the sql_always_where and sql_always_having filters

Use the always_filter

Use the conditionally_filter

In this lab, you learned how to filter Explores with LookML. Your first used the always_filter to require filtering on the order status and user country. You then used the sql_always_where and sql_always_having filters to filter the order creation date and the number of order items. Lastly, you used the conditionally_filter to filter the Order Items Explore to only return data for the past 3 years, unless a filter was applied to a user ID or state dimension.
